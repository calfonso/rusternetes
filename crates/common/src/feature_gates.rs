//! Process-wide feature gates — analogue of upstream
//! `k8s.io/component-base/featuregate`.
//!
//! Upstream Kubernetes wires feature gates through `utilfeature.DefaultFeatureGate`,
//! a global registry consulted by validators and admission controllers. We mirror
//! that surface with a small AtomicBool-backed registry so call sites can ask
//! `feature_gates::enabled(Feature::RelaxedDNSSearchValidation)` without
//! threading flags through every function signature.
//!
//! Each [`Feature`] variant carries its rusternetes default, which mirrors the
//! upstream default at the version rusternetes targets (currently v1.35).
//! Tests that need to flip a gate should use [`with_feature`] (the RAII guard
//! restores the previous value on drop) and pair the test with
//! `#[serial_test::serial]` because the registry is process-wide.
